# COLL 150 DATA SCIENCE/HUMAN DEVELOPMENT



***
Hi I am Ziyue and in sophomore year. I have my first year in University of St Andrews so this is actually my first year here and I am excited to experience life at W&M. I major in ECON and I am glad to learn more about data science, especially about how its progress essentially changes people's behavior:)
